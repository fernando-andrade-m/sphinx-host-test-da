Welcome to Land-Vector2Tile's documentation!
============================================

`Land-Vector2Tile <https://github.com/noaa-psd/land-vector2tile>`_ is comprised of code to map between vector format used by the Noah-MP offline driver, and the tile format used by the UFS atmospheric model. It is currently used to prepare input tile files for JEDI. These files include only those fields required by JEDI, rather than the full restart.
